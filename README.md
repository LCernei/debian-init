# OS-Tweaks

OS-Tweaks is a set of guidelines for environment setup after a fresh OS install.

This guide is available for:
* [Debian 10](./debian/)
* [Pop!_OS 19.10](./pop!_os/)
* [Windows 10](./win10/)

I created this guide based on my use-cases, but most configurations should work on any machine.

My hardware:
* __Laptop:__ Lenovo Legion Y530-15ICH
* __Processor:__ Intel Core i5-8300H
* __Memory:__ 8192 MB, DDR4-2666
* __Graphics adapter:__ NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 (Laptop)


## Installation
Follow the steps in the guide.
